# SRE Dashboard

SRE Dashboard is a dashboard for viewing, editing and analyzing Service Level
Objectives. It works in tandem with the `slo-generator` and requires the 
`Bigquery` exporter to be setup as it queries all data from BigQuery. 

SRE Dashboard is useful for both SRE teams and application teams to get a feel 
of where they're at in their SRE journey, SLO adoption and SLO targets.

## Backend

layer to make queries to BigQuery.

CSS for the HTML / CSS styling.
